        <h2>About the author</h2>        
        <p>Frédéric Guimont is a French Canadian born in Germany, grew up an army brat and learned to draw from books. One day, while dragging a pencil against the wall by the eraser, the lead pierced into his hand, breakingi off a piece of graphite into his palm. Nurses at the school tried to remove to no avail. The graphite seeped into his blood stream, giving him super-penciler skills.</p>
        <img src="images/selfie_web.jpg" alt=""/>
        <p>He worked on a little known comic titled Candy Apple Black in the early two thousands, adapted a few chapters of Orwell's 1984 and created designs for Hacker conferences such as H.O.P.E. (Hackers On Planet Earth) RECON (Reverse Engineering conference) and HackFest. He worked as a web developper for some time, creating charactercreator.org and worked on Ages of Empire IV as an interface designer for a short while before returning to his first love of comics with this short story.</p>
        <p>Ratel Ancestors is a glimpse into the history of Ratel, a character that will make his first appearance in his own comic title Ratel #1 this summer.</p>
