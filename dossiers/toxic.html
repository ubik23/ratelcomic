                    <p>Toxic grew up on a small farm where he learned to the value of a hard day's work from a young age. Throughout the years he's had a handfull of odd jobs but none quite like driving his truck to deliver the goods. Of course it wasn't his truck just yet, he'll have to continue saving to buy his very own rig.</p>
                    <p>Toxic hauls cargo up to Fort Mack and back as part of his daily grind but progress is slow. At least it was until he ran into Ratel at that diner that rainy day.</p>
                    <p>His favorite Hockey team is the Oilers and his favorite player is, of course, the greatest of all time: Wayne Gretzky.</p>
                    <p>Toxic spends his spare time cleaning his guns after taking them out for target practice. It's not clear how many he owns as he stores them in multiple locations.</p>
