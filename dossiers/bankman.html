                    <p>BankMan is part of the 1% that is untoucheable in this world. His wealth and power attracts the most <span class="censored">elite men and women with ambitions only he can fulfill</span>.</p>
                    <p>No one knows for sure the extent of his wealth and power, but no one doubts it is spectacular. Few know even of his existence as he prefers to keep his name out of the papers.</p>
                    <img src="pics/bankman_laughing.jpg" alt="BankMan" class="pix" />
                    <p>Whatever opinion you may have of the man, he operates within the law and has his tentacles in every aspect of peoples' lives within <span class="censored">Speed City</span>.</p>
                    <p>BankMan enjoys having brunch on the rooftop of his penthouse before boarding his <span class="censored">Agusta</span> helicopter to fly off to the first meeting of the day. He would love to upgrade to a V-22 Osprey but none are for sale on the private market just yet, though he knows a japanese businessman who could make it happen and it turns out that businessman owes him a favor.</p>
