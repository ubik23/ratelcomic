                    <p>Ratel grew up snowboarding in cold Canadian winters during the day and coding by night. His focus and dedication in both fields lead him to surpass his peers in many ways. He learned cryptography, networking and computer security, which allowed him to recognize the value of Bitcoin in its early days.</p>
                    <p>As his knowledge grew, so did his awareness of the systemic corruption of the world. In a naïve attempt to divert funds from the banks, he made mistakes that led to his arrest and incarceration for close to a decade. Fortunately he was able to leverage the simplicity of Bitcoin seed words and carried his fortune in his brain wallet for the duration of his sentence.</p>
                    <p>Upon his release, he uses his funds to build a collection of tools to help him continue the fight for justice, having learned the most important lesson: "Don't get caught".</p>
