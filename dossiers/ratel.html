                    <p>Ratel seemed to have come out of nowhere when he first appeared on the scene. A costumed vigilante with ingenuity as well as physical prowess. He grew up in Canada where he passed the winter time snowboarding during the day and coding by night. His focus and dedication in both fields lead him to surpass his peers in many ways. He studied cryptography, networking and computer security, which enabled him to notice and recognize the value of bitcoin in its early days.</p>

                    <p>As his knowledge grew, so did his awareness of the systemic corruption of the world. In a naïve attempt to divert funds from the banks, he made mistakes that led to his arrest and incarceration for close to a decade. Fortunately he was able to leverage the simplicity of Bitcoin seed words and carried his fortune in his brain wallet for the duration of his sentence.</p>
                    <p>Upon his release, he uses his funds to build a collection of tools to help him continue the fight for justice, having learned the most important lesson: <span class="censored">"Don't get caught"</span>.</p>
