                    <p>A body guard with a unique talent that serves as a side hustle in the form of a classical sculptor with a dark twist. Mia grew up in the poorest slums on the island of Haïti and was able to survive one of the most dangerous areas in the Western Hemisphere and figure out a way to make a place for herself in this harsh world through the use of dark, mystical powers she learned from the <span class="censored">voodoo priests</span> in her town. She leaves no trace of her victims, at least nothing that will stand up in the court of law, making her the ideal solution to many problems.</p>
                    <p>Her ascension from tent city to speed city has garnered her fear and respect among her peers. Her position in life, depends on the fortune of her biggest client, which so happens to be the wealthiest man in the city.</p>
                    <p>Her gift is also a curse as it prevents her from living a normal life, not that she would ever want to do that thankfully.</p>
