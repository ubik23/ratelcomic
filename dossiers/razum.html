                    <p>Razum is a product of the <span class="censored">Babochka</span> remote viewing program, a black ops project left over from the Soviet Russia Era that was subsequently terminated and dissolved. The agents were sold off like slaves to corporations, cartels or cults. These agents didn't choose to be born into such programs and many of them yearn for freedom for a life they've never known but can only dream of.</p>

                    <p>Razum has the bad habit of drowning out her thoughts with alcohol. When she gets inhibriated she has a cruel tendency to read people's minds and play with their emotions in manipulative ways and can even <span class="censored">betray their secrets to their entourage</span> if she's ever on a mean streak.</p>
                    <p>She's not a bad girl most of the time, though. Her situation pushes her to do things she'd rather not. She'd rather escape and discover what life could be outside of the grasp of the program. Her skills and ressources are not enough to escape but she awaits for an opportunity and she looks for someone who could help her.</p>
